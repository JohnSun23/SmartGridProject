SmartGridProject
================

A system for compressing smart grid data, and allowing queries on the compressed representation.  

### Getting Started ###
Create a directory, let's say SmartGridProject.  

Clone this github directory into SmartGridProject/src

Create another directory SmartGridProject/data.  

Run the script `run_all_analysis.sh`.  This will:
* load the smart grid data, preprocess it
*
